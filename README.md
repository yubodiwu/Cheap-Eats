Quarter 1 Project, searching for deals using Groupon and Google Places

This project makes use of the GroupOn Partner API and the Google Places API to find deals nearest to any address that's inputted. The starting screen just has a link to previous searched deals, a link to the GitHub Repo, and a box to input an address. After an address is input, the user is redirected to a page populated with deals sorted by distance to the input address. Clicking on the value of the deal redirects to the GroupOn page, and clicking on the distance link pops up a map modal with directions.

The most recent edits have been to the "ooprefactor" branch in an attempt to make the code more object oriented and easier to navigate.
